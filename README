Hi, this is my first time on github and I'm still leaning a lot.
  I've created this repositore to my personal goal that is to learn more about bash and one more generic goal to help people install linux things on chromebooks.

I'm still in my early years, english is my second language, progaming now is an on/off hobby (or it's hobbie ?) of mine and I'm on the last 2 years of high school.
You are free to edit any file, but try to keep them working and independent of third party apps (I HAAATEEE Snappy).
